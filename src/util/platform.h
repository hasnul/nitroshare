 * @brief Platform methods

 * Rather than depending on #define statements throughout the source code,
 * this class provides methods that can be invoked during runtime to determine
 * information about the current platform.
 *
 * It is important to note that the information provided by the first two
 * methods is determined during compile-time. Therefore, running an x86 build
 * of the application on 64-bit Windows will still cause currentArchitecture()
 * to indicate x86.
